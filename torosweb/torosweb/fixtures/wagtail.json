This instrument has already reached Argentine customs at Buenos Aires and after inspection, and adjustments it will be deployed at Cordon Mac\\u00f3n becoming the first instrument to work at the site in this pilto project for TOROS. The TOROS collaboration expects to determine the most suitable instrument for study of transients,particularly those associated with kilonovae explosions by the end of 2013. The key science target in this phase will be a survey of nearby galaxies for the early discovery of nearby supernovae for follow-up observations with large telescopes. This is a much needed activity for supernova astronomy, since all current southern hemisphere supernova surveys focus on cosmological supernovae and nearby ones are often missed.\\u00a0</p>\", \"lead\": \"The TORITOS project consists in deploying a small telescope in Cordon Macon to start testing operability at the site.\", \"image\": 4, \"caption\": \"\", \"featuredInColumnSection\": true, \"featuredInRowSection\": false}",

This information could not be captured by gravitational wave detectors alone.</p><p>In recent years, the TOROS collaboration has searched for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources using a variety of telescopes across the globe, and pursued funding opportunities to establish their own state-of-the-art CGWA telescope and camera at Cord\\u00f3n Mac\\u00f3n, in the remote Atacama region of northwestern Argentina and one of the best astronomical sites on earth.</p><p><b>ABOUT UTRGV</b></p><p>The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) was created by the Texas Legislature in 2013 as the first major public university of the 21st century in Texas.

The TOROS collaboration expects to determine the most suitable instrument for study of transients,particularly those associated with kilonovae explosions by the end of 2013. The key science target in this phase will be a survey of nearby galaxies for the early discovery of nearby supernovae for follow-up observations with large telescopes. This is a much needed activity for supernova astronomy, since all current southern hemisphere supernova surveys focus on cosmological supernovae and nearby ones are often missed.\u00a0</p>",

Diaz and the team will be able to monitor remotely any observations of deep space events based on alarms released through special <a href=\"https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-is-ligo\">LIGO</a> networks.</p><p>LIGO \u2013 the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory operated by Caltech and MIT \u2013 includes more than 1,200 scientists from around the world and is the world\u2019s largest gravitational wave observatory. In September 2017, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration announced the first joint detection of gravitational waves in the first significant signal recorded.</p><p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p><p>Diaz\u2019s project began six years when he, <a href=\"https://www.unc.edu.ar/comunicaci%C3%B3n/el-astr%C3%B3nomo-diego-garc%C3%ADa-lambas-fue-distinguido-por-el-senado-de-la-naci%C3%B3n\">Dr. Diego Garcia Lambas</a>, professor of astronomy and director of the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Astronomy at the University of C\u00f3rdoba in Argentina, and <a href=\"http://people.physics.tamu.edu/lmacri/\">Dr.  Lucas Macri,</a> professor of astronomy at Texas A&amp;M University and associate dean of the College of Science there, launched a collaboration, named \u201cTransient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South,\u201d referred to as <a href=\"https://toros.utrgv.edu/news/toritos-first-light/\">TOROS.</a> UTRGV and the University of C\u00f3rdoba in Argentina since then have signed agreements to develop this bi-national collaboration.<br/>In addition, TAMU professors Darren DePoy and Jennifer Marshall will use a portion of the funds to modify the TOROS telescope, building a \u201cprime-focus corrector\u201d in the Charles &amp; Judith Munnerlyn Astronomical and Space Sciences Laboratory at Texas A&amp;M.<br/>Diaz said this precisely-crafted set of lenses will maximize the field of view of a top-of-the-line camera that will be the dedicated instrument of the TOROS telescope.<br/>\u201cTOROS will make important contributions to the follow-up observation of gravitational wave sources,\u201d Diaz said, \u201cand will help develop the next generation of \u2018big data\u2019 astronomers across diverse communities in the Valley, and across Texas and Argentina.\u201d<br/>In addition to Diaz, UTRGV currently has two full-time scientists, 12 graduate and undergraduate students from the Edinburg and Brownsville campuses, and two teachers from local high schools (all members of the Time Domain Astronomy research group), actively participating in the binational project. Local high school physics teachers also are expected to engage area students in this research.</p><p><b>THE SCIENCE</b></p><p>One of the most important and frequent sources of gravitational waves are the collision of compact and dense objects, like two Black Holes. But if one of the two colliding objects is a neutron star \u2013 the latest stage in the evolution of stars, and a bit heavier than our Sun \u2013 or two neutron stars, space-time ripples will be produced during the event.<br/>However, a strong electromagnetic emission also occurs during collision, because the \u201cbreaking\u201d of one of the stars sheds matter, which whirls at breathtaking speeds around the new object being formed. In events of this sort, many of the chemical elements heavier than iron, like gold and platinum, are formed.</p><p></p><p>Because gravitational wave detectors have poor localization capabilities \u2013 that is, they cannot pinpoint the exact position of the source \u2013 wide field surveys provided by telescopes like the TOROS telescope could be extremely valuable in generating not only an exact localization of the source, but also other information associated with such events. This information could not be captured by gravitational wave detectors alone.</p><p>In recent years, the TOROS collaboration has searched for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources using a variety of telescopes across the globe, and pursued funding opportunities to establish their own state-of-the-art CGWA telescope and camera at Cord\u00f3n Mac\u00f3n, in the remote Atacama region of northwestern Argentina and one of the best astronomical sites on earth.</p><p><b>ABOUT UTRGV</b></p><p>The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) was created by the Texas Legislature in 2013 as the first major public university of the 21st century in Texas. This transformative initiative provided the opportunity to expand educational opportunities in the Rio Grande Valley, including a new School of Medicine, and made it possible for residents of the region to benefit from the Permanent University Fund \u2013 a public endowment contributing support to the University of Texas System and other institutions.</p><p>UTRGV has campuses and off-campus research and teaching sites throughout the Rio Grande Valley including in Boca Chica Beach, Brownsville (formerly The University of Texas at Brownsville campus), Edinburg (formerly The University of Texas-Pan American campus), Harlingen, McAllen, Port Isabel, Rio Grande City, and South Padre Island. UTRGV, a comprehensive academic institution, enrolled its first class in the fall of 2015, and the School of Medicine welcomed its first class in the summer of 2016.</p><hr/><p><b>MEDIA CONTACTS</b></p><p><b>Marci.Caltabiano@UTRGV.edu</b></p><p>UTRGV Director of News and Internal Communications <b>/</b> (956) 665-2742</p>",
